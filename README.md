# Eclat Daily Tasks - 2025

Welcome to my GitHub repository for daily tasks during my internship at Eclat Engineering. This repository contains all my tasks and progress for each day of the internship.

## Internship Learning Folder Structure

In the **Internship Learning** folder, you'll find several subfolders categorized by the specific topics or days I explored during my internship. Each subfolder contains files or documentation related to the respective day’s learning and tasks, making it easier for my mentor to explore and review my progress day by day.

## How to Navigate

1. **Internship Learning Folder**: This main folder contains all subfolders categorized by date or topic.
2. **Subfolders**: Each subfolder contains detailed notes, code snippets, or mini-projects corresponding to the day’s learning.
3. **README Files**: Some subfolders may include additional README files to provide context and clarity.
