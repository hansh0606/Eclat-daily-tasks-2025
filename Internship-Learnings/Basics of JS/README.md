# JavaScript Basics and Practice

This repository contains JavaScript exercises to understand key concepts.

## Concepts Explored

- **Variables & Data Types**: Working with strings, numbers, symbols, and performing comparisons.
- **Template Literals**: Using backticks to easily embed variables inside strings.
- **Functions**: Understanding regular functions and arrow functions.
- **Arrays**: Manipulating arrays using methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `concat()`, `flat()`, `flatMap()`, and `copyWithin()`.
- **Objects**: Creating and manipulating objects, including dynamic object creation through functions.
- **Loops**: Exploring loop types including `for`, `for of`, and `for in` for iterating over data structures.
  - **Simple Loop**: Iterating over arrays with the `for` loop.
  - **For Of Loop**: Iterating over array values using `for of`.
  - **For In Loop**: Iterating over object keys or indices in arrays.
- **Sum & Max Functions**: Implementing functions to calculate the sum of array elements and find the maximum value in an array.
  - **Sum Function**: Calculates the sum of array elements using the `for of` loop.
  - **Max Function**: Finds the maximum value from an array.
- **Frequency Counting**: Counting the frequency of letters and words in a phrase.
- **Array Methods**: `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for array manipulation.
- **Array of Objects**: Filtering, mapping, and displaying array data using `JSON.stringify()` and `join()`.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Displaying array data in HTML using `innerHTML`.

## Code Snippets

- **String Manipulation**: Demonstrates basic string operations with template literals for easy variable insertion.
- **Function Implementation**: Examples include printing even numbers and performing multiplication using arrow functions.
- **Array Operations**: Shows how to add, remove, and manipulate elements in arrays with various methods.
- **Object Handling**: Covers object creation, accessing properties, and using functions to generate dynamic content.
- **Looping Techniques**: Includes usage of `for`, `for of`, and `for in` loops for iterating over arrays and objects.
- **Sum and Max Functions**: Functions to sum array elements and find the maximum value in an array.
- **Frequency Counting**: Functions for letter and word frequency in a phrase.
- **Array Methods**: `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for array manipulation.
- **Array of Objects**: Filtering, mapping, and displaying data using `JSON.stringify()` and `join()`.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Displaying arrays of objects on the webpage dynamically.
